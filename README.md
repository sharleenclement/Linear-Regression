# Simple Linear Regression Project

## Revenue Prediction using simple linear regression.

### Problem Statement
You own an ice cream business and you would like to create a model that could predict the daily revenue in dollars based on the outside air temperature (degC). You decide that a Linear Regression model might be a good candidate to solve this problem.
Data set:

<ul>
<li>Independant variable X: Outside Air Temperature</li>
<li>Dependant variable Y: Overall daily revenue generated in dollars</li>
</ul>

## Project Overview:
I am using Linear Regression model to solve this problem.
